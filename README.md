### Hardware Validation Tools

This repository contains all the frameworks/scripts for testing various aspects of our electrical 
systems. In its most recent version, it contains scripts for testing the battery cells. We used 
a keysight b2902a SMU for running various test scenarios, as well as measuring the weight of 
every cell.
