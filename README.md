### Hardware Validation Tools
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/uw-midsun/validation-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/uw-midsun/validation-tools)

This repository contains all the frameworks/scripts for testing various aspects of our electrical 
systems. In its most recent version, it contains scripts for testing the battery cells. We used 
a keysight b2902a SMU for running various test scenarios, as well as measuring the weight of 
every cell.
